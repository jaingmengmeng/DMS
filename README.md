# To do next
To complete the function of "cd".  
For example, "cd ADC". When there is no folder named "ADC", my program will give a prompt and do nothing next. However, i want to make it be able to ask the user whether he want to make a new folder beyond the specified dirctory or not. Thus,"no" for rejection and "yes" for permission.
